# Worm Knot

This is a multiplayer snake clone. Up to 4 players can play against each other on one keyboard.

This program has a really special meaning. Today (2016) it has been 9 years ago since I wrote the first line of code for this game. It basically shows the first steps I’ve taken in C/C++, so it may be a little unprofessional. But everyone has to start somewhere.
